## Hacking projects 2025

The call for projects is now closed, and we are excited to announce this year’s selection.

Each BioHackathon project is proposed and led by a team of up to three co-leads, with in-person attendance encouraged for collaborative work. The BioHackathon fosters innovation, practical development and teamwork in support of the ELIXIR and wider life science communities. This year’s projects cover topics in research data management, FAIR principles, training metadata, software interoperability, AI-readiness and more.

### Project list

The titles of the projects selected by the Programme Committee for the 2025 edition of BioHackathon Europe are listed alphabetically below. Moving forward, links to the abstracts will be added, and co-leads are encouraged to submit pull requests to amend the project details.
