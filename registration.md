## Participant expression of interest for in-person attendance

Participants are welcome to join BioHackathon Europe, either on-site or online, regardless of project submission. Attendance is free, but in-person participants must cover their own travel and accommodation costs. For pricing details, visit the [Venue page](/venue/).

The expression of interest period for **BioHackathon Europe 2026** will open at the end of June. Please note that all in-person participants are required to stay for the whole duration of the BioHackathon, at the event venue.

## Who can register?

Everyone is encouraged to submit project proposals for BioHackathon Europe, irrespective of affiliation. Although ELIXIR Europe organises and funds this event, participants from industry, SMEs and non-ELIXIR countries or organisations are welcome to express their interest for in-person attendance.

If you have any queries about this, please contact <biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org>.

## Registration and attendance

Project co-leads will be invited to register via direct email and will receive specific registration instructions.

All other participants may express interest in registering to attend the event in person (face to face) between **26 June and 17 July**. All expressions of interest to attend in person will be reviewed, taking into account event and project needs, as well as ELIXIR’s commitment to gender balance and diversity.

Participants accepted to attend in person will be notified before the end of July. Attendance will only be fully confirmed once accepted participants have paid the venue for their accommodation.

### Virtual attendance

Participants wishing to attend virtually may register at any time. At present, we do not expect virtual registration to close ahead of the BioHackathon.

## Funding

BioHackathon Europe is committed to open participation. Approved project proposal co-leads may designate up to three participants for on-site attendance, regardless of affiliation. This allocation will be determined during project proposal submission. Since these reserved seats reduce availability for open registration, the following guidelines apply:
- A maximum of three on-site participants per project can be reserved
- ELIXIR may fund up to two of these participants, provided they belong to an ELIXIR Node
- ELIXIR will not provide any additional funding beyond this

## What ELIXIR covers

All meals at the venue, from lunch on Monday through to lunch on Friday, are covered for all in-person attendees.

ELIXIR will also cover the following costs for funded project co-leads:
- **Accommodation:** Four nights at the venue (see the Venue page for details). ELIXIR will pay this directly, so funded participants do not need to arrange payment
- **Transport to and from the venue:** Reimbursement of up to **€400 (including VAT)** on a claim basis for transport only (this includes flights, public transport and taxis). Please note that ELIXIR will not reimburse any amount over €400

Please note that no food or drink expenses will be reimbursed by ELIXIR. This includes any food or drink purchased while travelling to and from the venue, and during the event.

Funded co-leads will receive an email in early July with the deadline for submitting reimbursement claims. Transport expense claims can only be submitted after the event has taken place and will only be processed once all required documentation has been provided.

**Important:** This funding is strictly for the BioHackathon event and cannot be transferred to another attendee or event.
