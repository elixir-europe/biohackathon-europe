## Participant registration

**Registration for BioHackathon Europe 2025 will open in June** 

Participants are welcome to join BioHackathon Europe, either on-site or online, regardless of project submission. It’s free to attend BioHackathon Europe. Attendance is free, but in-person participants must cover their own travel and accommodation costs. For pricing details, visit the Venue page [Venue page](/venue/). Please note that all in-person participants are required to stay for the whole duration of the BioHackathon.

## Who can register?
Everyone is encouraged to submit project proposals for BioHackathon Europe, irrespective of affiliation. Although ELIXIR Europe organises and funds this event, participants from industry, SMEs and non-ELIXIR countries or organisations are welcome to register. 

If you have any queries about this, please contact <biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org>.

## Funding 

BioHackathon Europe is committed to open participation. Each approved project proposal leads may designate up to three participants for on-site attendance, regardless of affiliation. This allocation will be determined during project proposal submission. Since these reserved seats reduce availability for open registration, the following guidelines apply:
  * A maximum of three on-site participants per project can be reserved
  * ELIXIR may fund up to two of these participants, provided they belong to an ELIXIR Node
  * ELIXIR will not provide any additional funding beyond this

## What ELIXIR covers

ELIXIR covers the following costs for funded participants: 
  * **Accommodation:** Four nights at the venue (see Venue page for details). ELIXIR pays this directly, so funded participants don’t need to arrange payment
  * **Meals:** All meals at the venue for the duration of the event – *this applies to all participants, not just funded attendees*
  * **Travel:** Reimbursement of up to €400 (including VAT) on a claim basis

Accommodation and meal costs at the venue are paid directly by ELIXIR, while travel expenses will be reimbursed after the event. Funded participants will receive an email around July with the deadline for submitting their reimbursement claims.

Important: This funding is strictly for the BioHackathon event and cannot be transferred to another attendee or event.
