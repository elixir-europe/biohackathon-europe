## Participant registration

Everyone with an interest in joining in person needs to register their interest to attend during that time period. After that all expressions of interest will be reviewed and accepted in-person attendees will be notified by the end of July. Project co-leads are invited to confirm their registration prior to the end of June via a separate link. Virtual registration is open until right before the event.

Participants are welcome to join BioHackathon Europe, either on-site or online, regardless of project submission. Attendance is free, but in-person participants must cover their own travel and accommodation costs. For pricing details, visit the Venue page [Venue page](/venue/). Please note that all in-person participants are required to stay for the whole duration of the BioHackathon.

## Who can register?
Everyone is encouraged to submit project proposals for BioHackathon Europe, irrespective of affiliation. Although ELIXIR Europe organises and funds this event, participants from industry, SMEs and non-ELIXIR countries or organisations are welcome to register. 

If you have any queries about this, please contact <biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org>.

## Funding 

BioHackathon Europe is committed to open participation. Each approved project proposal leads may designate up to three participants for in-person attendance, regardless of affiliation. This allocation will be determined during project proposal submission. Since these reserved seats reduce availability for open registration, the following guidelines apply:
  * A maximum of three in-person participants per project can be reserved
  * ELIXIR may fund up to two of these participants, provided they belong to an ELIXIR Node
  * ELIXIR will not provide any additional funding beyond this

## What ELIXIR covers

The following costs are covered for **all in-person attendees**: 
  * **Meals:** All meals at the venue from lunch on Monday to lunch on Friday at the event

Additionally, ELIXIR covers the following costs for **funded project co-leads**:
  * **Accommodation:** Four nights at the venue (see Venue page for details). ELIXIR pays this directly, so funded participants don’t need to arrange payment
  * **Transport to and from the venue:** Reimbursement of up to €400 (including VAT) on a claim basis for transport only (flights, public transport and taxis)

Accommodation and meal costs at the venue are paid directly by ELIXIR, while reimbursement for transport to and from the venue will be processed after the event. Funded participants will receive an email around July with the deadline for submitting their reimbursement claims. Please note that all expenses for food and refreshments purchased while travelling will not be reimbursed.

Important: This funding is strictly for the BioHackathon event and cannot be transferred to another attendee or event.
