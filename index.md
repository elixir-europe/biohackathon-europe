BioHackathon Europe is an annual event that brings together bioinformaticians and computational biologists from around the world. It’s organised by [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/), and offers an intense week of hacking, with participants working on diverse and exciting projects. BioHackathon is a community-driven event, which provides an opportunity for members of the life sciences community to meet and work together on topics of common interest. **The goal is to create code that addresses challenges in bioinformatics research.** 

This year we are holding the BioHackathon at Hotel Esplanade Resort in Berlin, Germany from 3 to 7 November (see the [Venue page](/venue/)), with remote access available if you cannot attend in person. **Registration will open in June 2025 – the exact date will be confirmed before then.**

Maybe just include them (but less intuitive to edit that way).

## Scope
The BioHackathon provides space for collaboration and innovation in computational biology and bioinformatics. Participants engage in intensive, hands-on programming and content-creation activities, data integration and software development. The topics are aligned with the needs of ELIXIR [Platforms](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms), [Communities](https://elixir-europe.org/communities) and [Focus Groups](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups), as captured in the ELIXIR Scientific Programme.

## Goals
The key objective of BioHackathon Europe is to advance the development of an open-source service infrastructure to accelerate scientific innovation. We focus on areas that support the work of ELIXIR Platforms, Communities and Focus Groups, covering areas such as FAIR principles, identifiers, metadata standards, ontologies and metadata catalogues by engaging technical experts in the bioinformatics community, both within and beyond ELIXIR, to collaborate on topics of common interest aligned with ELIXIR activities.

## Code of Conduct
BioHackathon Europe follows the [ELIXIR Code of Conduct](https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct) to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all participants. The Code of Conduct applies to both in-person and virtual interactions during the event.

## Our commitment to gender balance and diversity

ELIXIR is committed to creating an inclusive environment where all participants can thrive, and this is reflected in our approach to the BioHackathon. We actively encourage gender-balanced and diverse representation across all roles. This commitment is grounded in ELIXIR’s wider efforts. ELIXIR’s Scientific Advisory Board calls for nominations that consider balance in skills, expertise and gender. The Heads of Nodes have highlighted the need for more gender-balanced Executive Committee selection. We are also aligned with the STEERS Gender Equality Plan Strategy – supporting institutes in embedding gender equity frameworks – and with ELEAD, which empowers women to take on leadership and managerial roles within ELIXIR.

When the expression of interest phase opens at the end of June, we ask project co-leads to actively consider gender balance and diversity in project teams. As organisers, we will do our best to facilitate balanced and diverse onsite participation with respect to venue capacity, project interest and diversity. Diverse teams drive better collaboration and stronger outcomes.
