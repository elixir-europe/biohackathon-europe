## Campus Belloch

We are pleased to confirm that the 2026 BioHackathon will be held at Campus Belloch, which is approximately 30 minutes from Barcelona. Set within a 200-hectare estate, the venue is surrounded by greenery and includes a private park, providing a calm environment well suited to both focused collaboration and relaxation.

Surrounded by forests and forest nurseries, and framed by mountains and sea, environmental preservation is a core principle of the Campus. Its minimalist architecture has been designed to work in harmony with the natural surroundings, with sustainability as a key priority.

We look forward to welcoming participants to Campus Belloch for a week of productive work, networking and informal social activities.
