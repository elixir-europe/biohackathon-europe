Each November, ELIXIR Europe organises BioHackathon Europe, bringing together bioinformaticians from around the world. The event takes place in different locations around Europe.

The BioHackathon offers an intense week of hacking, with over 160 international F2F participants who work on diverse and impactful bioinformatics projects. The week kicks off with a half-day symposium, introducing the projects and setting the stage for five days of dedicated hacking â€“ all with one goal: developing solutions to key challenges in bioinformatics.

The first BioHackathon Europe was held in Paris in 2018, inspired by the long-standing BioHackathons organised in Japan by the National Bioscience Database Center [(NBDC)](https://biosciencedbc.jp/?lng=en) and Database Center for Life Science [(DBCLS)](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html) since 2008 (see their [BioHackathon website](http://www.biohackathon.org/)).
